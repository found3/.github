THE FOUND3 (Pronounced `The Foundry`) is an open-collective aimed at [BlockSmith](https://github.com/found3/blocksmith) a voxel based survival-sandbox platform and opinionated default 'game' built on it. 


Using the amazing [Godot_Voxel](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel) and a fork of [VoxelGame](https://github.com/Zylann/voxelgame), notably to focus on and extend "Block_Game".
