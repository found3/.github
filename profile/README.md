## Proj Map
- [Cubicle](https://github.com/found3/cubicle) 

`=` Inherited from blocky_game and what will be the underlying example mod for Blocksmith "eventually". 

- [Techtonic](https://github.com/found3/techtonic)

`=` Automation-centric experience based around 'godems', programmable golems; Meant for education (self and otherwise).

- [Ingots](https://github.com/found3/ingots)

`=` Stuff built-on top of Ores. If not the most basic functionality, or goes into a specific modpack should go here.

- [Ores](https://github.com/found3/ores)

`=` The 'Ore' Mechanics; The most basic stuff needed for a blocksmith game.
